# Week 1 Assignment - Sensor Data Analysis

This repo contains my Week 1 submission for the internship/course.

## Contents
- `week1_assignment.ipynb`: Code for feature engineering and data visualization
- `sensor.csv`: Dataset used
- `README.md`: Project overview

## Summary
- Added a new feature: average of `sensor_0`, `sensor_1`, `sensor_2`
- Plotted a correlation heatmap for the first 20 sensors
- Visualized label distribution using a bar chart

## Tools
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Week 2 Assignment - Model Building & Serialization
Objectives:

Preprocessed the data and converted categorical values using LabelEncoder.

Trained a machine learning model using RandomForestClassifier (or similar).

Evaluated model using accuracy score and confusion matrix.

Serialized the trained model to a .pkl file using pickle.

Output:

Model saved as: Farm_Irrigation_System.pkl

Code for training and exporting included in Irrigation_System.ipynb

## How to Run
Clone or download this repository.

Open Irrigation_System.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

Run all cells to:

Analyze the dataset

Train the model

Export the trained model as a .pkl file
