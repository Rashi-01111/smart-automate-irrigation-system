✅ Problem Statement
Manual irrigation often leads to water wastage and inefficient farming. This project aims to develop an automated irrigation system that uses sensor data to control sprinklers intelligently, improving crop health while conserving water.

🚀 Features & Highlights
Multi-label classification using Random Forest to predict multiple sprinkler statuses

Cleaned and prepared real-world sensor data for training

Developed an interactive Streamlit web app for live predictions

Visualized sensor correlations and label distributions for better understanding

Deployed a trained model using joblib for scalable use

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python 3.13

pandas, numpy – Data handling

matplotlib, seaborn – Visualization

scikit-learn – Machine learning

joblib – Model saving/loading

streamlit – Web app for user interaction

Developed using Jupyter Notebook and VS Code
